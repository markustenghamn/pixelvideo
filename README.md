# pixelvideo
A simple example of how to use the golang [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) library to make a video

Simply run `go run main.go` and the program will run and generate a test.avi file in the current directory.

If you would like to see what is happening while the program does the rendering simply change invisible to false in the window configuration.

The generated video may give an error. I recommend using [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) and if it prompts to fix any issues then let it do that.
